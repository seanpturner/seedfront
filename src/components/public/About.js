                    <p>I started growing cannabis, like many of you, just because it made sense. It's less expensive to grow it than to buy it. That turned into a love of growing cannabis which then turned into a love of breeding cannabis.</p>
                    <p>At some point, I started sharing some of my seeds with my friends, and then a good friend pointed out to me that I could actually sell my seeds. I didn't really believe it at first, but not long after that, I became known as "the seed guy" and it seemed like everybody I knew was buying seeds from me. I really just fell into this that easily.</p>
                    <p>After a few years, my wife pointed out to me that if I were to run it like a business, and actually try to broaden my base, that I could probably quit my day job. For the second time, I was left wondering why I hadn't thought of it first. So, I pushed a little bit, made a few sales and even supplied a few farms with my seeds and breeds.</p>
                    <p>Now, this web site represents the latest step in my journey. I'm sticking with my own finely-cultivated breeds so that you can enjoy the best Boutique Seeds you can find.</p>
